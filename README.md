# JSONSourcery

JSONSourcery is a library built on top of the [Racket json](https://docs.racket-lang.org/json/) base package in order to add automatic and manual JSON serialization in order to enable Racket values to be used directly for computation with less boilerplate needed to convert to JSON as well as adding clarifying syntax macros.
